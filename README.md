# VRColony

An attempt at a VR Colony Management Sim

Currently at the bare-bones in development. This project has mostly been left alone due to oculus drivers being outmoded in the version of Unity used in this project. The XR rig broke down upon the outmoding of the drivers making testing during development impossible.

Currently features a malfunctioning XR rig and a basic 3D model. There are a few scripts attached attempting to generate a 3D grid for terrain generation. This was built during my early days before I understood how grids worked.

Currently planning on tackling this again once I can get terrain generation down.

## UPDATE:

Updated to latest version of Unity and XR rig errors are now resolved!

Development can continue pending further interest.
